Serial Interface:
    Input rx "receive"; Output tx "transmit";

    Receive:
        When line is idle, rx = 1.
        For each byte:
            Start bit: rx = 0
            8 bits in the byte. LSB is sent first.
            End bit: rx = 1

    Oversample rx by 8x.
    Wait until you see rx != 1 for 2 cycles (maybe 3?).
    At that point, start generating another clock "baudtick" which ticks every 8 cycles.
    At each tick of "baudtick":
        advance state machine
